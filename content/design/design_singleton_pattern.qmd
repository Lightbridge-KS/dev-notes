# Singleton Pattern

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="false"}
**Q:** I've encountered concept called "Singleton Pattern" through this Dart code: `RamaaiService._()`.

Please explain the concept and why it is useful:


```dart
class RamaaiService {
  RamaAiClient? _client;
  static RamaaiService? _instance;

  RamaaiService._();

  /// Get singleton instance
  static RamaaiService get instance {
    _instance ??= RamaaiService._();
    return _instance!;
  }
}
```
:::


The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application's lifetime and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Understanding the Code

Let me break down your Dart example:

```
Class Structure:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│       RamaaiService         │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ - _client: RamaAiClient?    │ ← Instance variable
│ - _instance: static         │ ← Holds the single instance
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ - RamaaiService._()         │ ← Private constructor
│ + instance: static getter   │ ← Public access point
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Components:**

- `RamaaiService._()` - Private constructor (the underscore makes it private in Dart)
- `_instance` - Static variable that holds the single instance
- `instance` getter - Public method to access the singleton

**Flow Diagram:**

```
First Call:
User → instance getter → _instance is null? → Create new RamaaiService._() → Store in _instance → Return instance

Subsequent Calls:
User → instance getter → _instance exists? → Return existing instance
```

## Why Singleton is Useful

**Resource Management:**

- Ensures expensive resources (like database connections, API clients) are created only once
- Prevents memory waste from multiple identical objects

**Global State:**

- Provides a single point of truth for shared data
- Ensures consistency across your application

**Coordination:**

- Perfect for services that coordinate activities (logging, configuration, caching)

## Python Equivalent

Since you prefer Python, here's how you'd implement the same pattern:

```python
class RamaaiService:
    _instance = None
    _client = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
    
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance
```

## Real-World Medical AI Example

In your radiology AI context, you might use Singleton for:

```python
class DicomProcessor:
    _instance = None
    _model = None  # Expensive ML model
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._instance._load_ai_model()  # Load once
        return cls._instance
    
    def _load_ai_model(self):
        # Load heavy AI model (time-consuming)
        self._model = load_radiology_ai_model()
    
    def process_dicom(self, dicom_file):
        return self._model.predict(dicom_file)
```

This ensures your expensive AI model loads only once, regardless of how many times you need to process DICOM files throughout your application.

**When to Use Singleton:**

- Database connections
- Configuration managers
- Logging services
- AI model instances (as in your case)
- Cache managers

**Simple Rule:** If creating multiple instances would waste resources or cause inconsistency, consider Singleton.
